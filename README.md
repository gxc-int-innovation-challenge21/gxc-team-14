# About SNOW RIDER

Welcome to **SNOW RIDER's** repository. The team **GREEN SHAPERS** developed this app over the course of three months for the **Global Exchange Challange**.
What we wanted to achieve with our app, was to reduce CO2 emmission generated by wintersport in general. Be it big events like world cups, or just a weekend trip for hobby wintersport enthusiasts, as we call them. Conceptually we provide a platform where people can offer rides and become passengers in such rides to reduce the number of cars that drive to wintersport resorts. Our storyboard demonstrates how this could work:

## Additional Features

As you might have figured from the fifth panel, we thought of some additional features. The one visible, is a bus. Our idea was that, if in a given area there are a lot of people traveling to the same destination, in the same time frame, the DSV (our Challange giver) could provide a bus to even further reduce CO2 output.
Additionally we wanted to show people how much of a difference they make. So we implemented a CO2-calculator, that shows you how much CO2 you prevented from being produced. We also thought it would be neat if for a set ammount of CO2 saved, a tree would be planted. In our prototype we went with 50kg for one tree. To give you a preview of how this could look:

Should our Idea sound like something you would be interested in, have a look at our prototype:

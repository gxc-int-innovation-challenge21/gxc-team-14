# About SNOW RIDER

Welcome to **SNOW RIDER's** repository. The team **GREEN SHAPERS** developed this app over the course of three months for the **Global Exchenge Challange**.
What we wanted to achieve with our app, was to reduce CO2 emmission generated by wintersport in general. Be it big events like world cups, or just a weekend trip for hobby wintersport enthusiasts, as we call them. Conceptually we provide a platform where people can offer rides and become passengers in such rides to reduce the number of cars that drive to wintersport resorts. Our storyboard demonstrates this core feature, as well as one additonal feature.

## Additional Features

As you might have figured from the fifth panel, we thought of some additional features. The one visible, is a bus. Our idea was that, if in a given area there are a lot of people traveling to the same destination, in the same time frame, the DSV (our Challange giver) could provide a bus to even further reduce CO2 output.
Additionally we wanted to show people how much of a difference they make. So we implemented a CO2-calculator, that shows you how much CO2 you prevented from being produced. We also thought it would be neat if for a set ammount of CO2 saved, a tree would be planted. In our prototype we went with 50kg for one tree. To give you a preview of how this could look:

Should our Idea sound like something you would be interested in, have a look at our prototype:
